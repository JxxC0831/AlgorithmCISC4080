# Lab3: coinchange_lab

In this lab, we solve different versions of the CoinChange problems, making use of recursive methods to explore all combinations. 


## Download starter code

If you have installed command **git**, from your terminal (mac or WSL/Ubunto) window, you can use the following command to download it:
```
git clone https://github.com/CISC4080/coinchange_lab.git
```
Otherwise, you can download the starter code as a zip file. 

## Requirements:

1. Implement the function **CoinChangeK** that solves K-of-a-kind, answering the existence question.
2. Implement the function **UnlimitedCoinChange** that solves the unlimited variation of coin-change problem, finding the optimal solution.
3. Test your code using the testcases given in **main.cpp**. 

Note: Implement these two functions recursively, based upon the logic learnt in class (i.e., use decision tree to guide your design of the 
recursive algorithm). 


## Deadlines and Submission

Please submit your **coin_change.cpp** by Tuesday April 9th to the following submission link:
